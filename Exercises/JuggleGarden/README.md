Description
I expanded on the paddle activity, and gave it a new meaning. The goal of the game is to keep all three frogs above water, while collecting 15 coins with the lily pad. Most of the games I made previously have been pretty easy. Therefore, I wanted to make this one more challenging. The frogs will bounce off of both the log and the lily pad. However, the bounce of the frog will be different between both objects.

Controls
Mouse to move lily pad
A and D to move log

*Note
I put the controls button, and the titlescreen button on the controls page to close. You need to click before the T on CONTROLS to activate.
sorry!
