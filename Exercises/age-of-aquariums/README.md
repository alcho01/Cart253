Age of Aquariums

I decided to stick with the theme of the exercise. The code is pretty straight-forward. I have the user controlled shape act as the octopus. The movement is done with the arrow keys. The user interacts with the fish by overlapping them and the fish disappearing. Also, when the user interacts with the fish, the user grows, and projects "ink" a black ellipse generates for a split second. I added speed as another parameter for both the fish and crab. As well as a game over screen, and a completed screen. I additionally added a health system and a fish counter to keep track of how many fish remain.
