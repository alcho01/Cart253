Title: Dodge-Em

Description of the exercise: I was initially going to do something more "deep" - However, I went for a more light-hearted approach. It is also a random idea that popped up in my mind, and I thought it was creative, so I stuck with it. Flying burgers, a man on a jetpack in a sky of purple clouds. The more the stick figure interacts(eats) with the hamburgers flying his way, the more he grows. If he reaches a certain size, he will start hallucinating, and white points will fill the page. If he exceeds the amount he can eat after hallucinating, the simulation will stop.
