Title: Love-Actually

I ended up changing the concept completely. Instead of the two entities trying to intertwine, they must avoid one another. I used my own created assets from Illustrator to provide a new look.

The controls are:
Starting/Opening the game - Click the mouse to begin the simulation.
In Simulation - Use all arrow keys except the left key to navigate to the end.

"Easter Egg" / Secret Ending
A cop car will spawn in the simulation if the user's horizontal velocity is higher than 15. The user's horizontal velocity ranges from 1 to 20 (25%). If you get caught, another screen will pop up. That is the other ending.
