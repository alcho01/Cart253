Project 1 - Simulation

Title: HIKE
Author: Alex Cho

I learned a lot when creating this project. The simulation/game is meant to be visual as well as interactive. Interactivity in the game includes mouse interaction, and keyboard input. The vision going into this was to make some type of Christmas game. However, I started playing around with the code, and one idea led to another and I ended up with this as the end result.

The concept is to relax but still be alert. The game is meant to be easy. What I intended, was for the user to interact with the environment by pressing the buttons located on the right and enjoying the scenery. However, I also wanted them to pay attention to their surroundings. That is the purpose of the rocks. It relates to the idea of people who take selfies/pictures without realizing the possible dangers. How they put their lives at risk without realizing it.

I am pretty happy with how the program turned out. I know my code is a little all over. Hopefully, I can make the code less repetitive and cleaner for future projects. I did not want to play around with it too much in case it would mess something up.
