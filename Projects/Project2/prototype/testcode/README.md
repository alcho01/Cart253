I tested a few things to make sure I knew it was possible.
The main focus for this prototype is to assure that when the mouse is hovered over an object that is interactable,
it will notify the user of that. (The object will change to black and white)
The other element I wanted to test, was the actual interactivity of the object when the mouse is clicked.
For this example, when the lamp is clicked an overlay will display a lighter shade. (NEEDS TO BE GREYED OUT TO DISPLAY LIGHT)
When it is clicked again it will switch to a darker shade
For the prototype I didn't create classes(Exception raindrop), or really tidy up the code. I will do both of these things in the final assignment.

Other small things,
- Included raindrops. I wanted to see how it would look like.
- A simple cursor change when it hovers over an interactable entity.
- Switch states with KeyPressed

These are some of the  fundamental elements required for my final project.

Note, the lamp is the one on the floor not the orange thing.
