Artist Statement

The vision going into this was to create a point-and-click game in a Lo-Fi Room. I set out what I planned to do. Ultimately, I am proud of the final product. The main interaction was meant to be mouse-clicking hence the genre of game it is. A lot of the code has an emphasis on determining what state it currently is then applying the other elements like the p5 elements, arrays, conditionals, displaying images, etc. Technically, I am pleased with the outcome because the program works and does what I envisioned it to do. The hardest part was doing the code for each task because they are the bigger ideas of the game and require a lot more thought. I am happy with how they turned out. Building the rooms and creating the mouse interactivity was tedious, draining, and repetitive. However, it worked out in the end, so I have nothing to complain about. Artistically, a lot of the assets I got from other resources because I would not have enough time to do both, and the code is more important than the aesthetics. However, it still was a process to design the layout of each room, then implement what goes where, and cross my fingers that it works with the code. The goal was to create a Lo-Fi room, and I think the aesthetics demonstrate that. I was very select on the type of entities I wanted to display for each room. I was inspired by the tv series "Black Mirror," and more specifically the episode "White Bear" where the protagonist has to live the same day over and over again.


Description of the Game

You are controlling John. John is quite depressed because he has been a part of the 3:00 am cycle for over a week. The 3:00 am cycle reflects the time of day that keeps repeating itself when it is about to hit 4:00 am. He can't fall asleep unless he completes his tasks. The problem is he doesn't know where to look or where to begin.  In hopes of completing his tasks, John is optimistic that the 3:00 am cycle will be broken, and can finally go to bed and resume his life.

The concept of the game is to break the cycle repeatedly resetting at 3:00am. To do so it requires the completion of 4 tasks that can be found throughout the rooms. There is a variety of puzzle games that require memorization, logic and attention. Hints are scattered around the room to unlock certain steps or create an easier time for the user.

For the controls, please resort to the help screen.
To go on to the next cutscene press any key.


Other Thoughts

I was challenged throughout this process. I think a problem that I have is I doubt the work I put forward. Often I would look at the Discord and see other students work... and I would be like "Man! this is really good, and mine is not." But I look at my progress and understanding of programming and I am proud of what I achieved, and consider this my best work so far. Not only did I learn how to program, I built confidence in the ability to program.

Step 2 - It asks for a username and a password
Step 3 - To find the username click on the bed lamp to find the word. Username is "sleep" *No Caps
Step 4 - To find the password click on the left arrow to transfer to room2. There will be 4 post-it notes displaying a number. Password is "7259"
Step 5 - Now correctly type the input for each when prompted with the login screen
*Step 6 - Click the blue icon "Lofify" and select a song to give the game that lofi feeling. Songs can be changed through this app.
Step 7 - Click the green icon "Atom" and correctly type the simple line of code. Correct Input "image(object.image, object.x, object.y, object.w, object.h);"  Notice the spaces also

Step 9 - The white numbers indicate the order of each missing digit which will be useful for further use. the number is "885571"
Step 10 - Before leaving the Main room click the pile of papers which will give many hints for future use.
Step 11 - The next task is on room2 which is the room on the left. Click the aquarium to begin the task.
Step 12 - Hover over the question mark to complete the task. Typo error it's not the size that will decrease, it's the food eaten.
Step 13 - When the task is complete collect the key
Step 14 - The key unlocks the door on room 3 but it isn't that useful at the moment because there is no where else to go
Step 15 - A good idea is to always look around the room before starting a task. Click the backpack. It gives a clue for the phone task.
Step 16 - Now the phone is asking for a six digit password.
Step 17 - Go back to the notes in the main room. You will see a flower pot with a # on it. Also we still have the sudo-cube code which represents a HEX colour code.
Step 18 - If you looked around in room 2 you would have noticed that the orange book is interactable. Click it and it will have the same sudo-cube code "885571"
Step 19 - Now we know that the code specifies a colour in HEX and the papers indicated a flower pot with a # we can link one and one together. Click on the fourth flower pot.
Step 20 - It will prompt a piece of paper with numbers. It is the code for the phone. The code is "371629" click the paper to fold the paper away.
Step 21 - Now enter the code in the phone by clicking the correct digits.
Step 22 - Go to the Photos application and take in every aspect.
Step 23 - Do the same for the Notes application.
Step 24 - Click the Crossy application and begin the game.
Step 25 - Complete the quiz Answers 1- "Z" 2- "Red" 3- "Zesty" 4- "25" 5- "Crossy" Caps is important for this.

Step 27 - Go back to the papers in the main room. The second page shows the 5 doors which is seen when entering through the large door in room 3.
Step 28 - It circles the fourth door and indicates that there is a clue in the bear's body.
Step 29 - Go to room 2, and click on the bear.
Step 30 - Ok, now that you got the clue go through the door on room 3, and check under door mat 2.
Step 31 - Collect the key, and open up door 4.
Step 32 - Play the sequence of notes displayed at the top. Sequence is "dfgasfddfgasda"

This is the "proper" way to play the game. You might find the hidden ending or other elements not described in the steps.


Hidden Ending
There is a hidden ending in the game that can make the game instantly. However, it is considered a bad ending. If the user goes to room 2(The room on the left) and clicks the "Game Over" Poster the game will cut to a cutscene.
